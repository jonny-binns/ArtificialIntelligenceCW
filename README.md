# Artificial Intelligence Coursework

Task of this coursework was to impliment Dijkstra's algorithm and calculate the shortest route possible between a series of underground caves, connected by tunnels.

### Aims:
* Gain knowledge of Dijkstra's algorithm by creating an implementation in a chosen language
* Improve skills around inputting and outputting information to text files
* Improve optimisation skills with the chosen language as time limits were placed on the testing of the implementation
